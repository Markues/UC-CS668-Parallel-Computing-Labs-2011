This lab you can choose one of two of the following problems:

# Prob1 

Design and implement a version of radix sort. Radix sort is a very simple and very fast method of sorting that exploits positional fixed-length number systems. Descriptions of radix sort can be found in most algorithm textbooks and Wikipedia.

 1. Write a sequential version of radix sort in C/C++ that sorts lists of 4K 32-bit (unsigned) integers.
 2. Write a parallel cuda version of radix sort that sorts lists of 4K 32-bit (unsigned) integers using a kernel with shared memory in a single block. Describe the speedups you achieve.
 3. (Extra Credit) Write a parallel cuda version of radix sort that sorts lists of 1M 32-bit (unsigned) integers using a multi-block kernel. Describe the speedups you achieve.

# Prob2

Design and implement a parallel program to produce any single graphic or animation. The choice of graphic is yours to make. Here are some possible suggestions:

 1. visual for Mandelbrot set, Julia set, or other fractal.
 2. visual for the volatility of Black-Scholes model of financial markets.
 3. visual for the chaos of fish-equation from CS0-2009, http://t.co/soxVllI
